# An Unexpected Passenger

## The Diplomatic Mission

While transporting delegates from two alien species to a conference, the Enterprise encounters a mysterious energy cloud. The ship's passage through this phenomenon leads to a series of inexplicable events affecting both crew and computer systems.

## The Entity's Influence

### Spreading Effect
The energy being moves through the ship's systems and crew members:
- Assistant Chief Engineer Singh exhibits strange behavior
- Dr. Crusher notices unusual medical readings
- Data demonstrates uncharacteristic actions
- Captain Picard becomes the final host

## Resolution

The crew must find a way to separate the entity from their captain while maintaining their diplomatic responsibilities to their passengers.
