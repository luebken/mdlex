# First Encounter with the Ferengi

## Initial Contact

The Enterprise pursues a Ferengi vessel that has stolen a T-9 energy converter. Both ships become immobilized by a mysterious force emanating from a nearby planet, leading to the Federation's first full contact with the Ferengi Alliance.

## The Ancient Mystery

### Portal's Influence
- Both ships discover they are held in place by an ancient portal
- The portal begins draining energy from both vessels
- Teams from both ships must investigate the surface
- Ancient technology reveals tests of worthiness

## Resolution

The crew discovers the portal is controlled by the remnants of the Tkon Empire, testing both species' worthiness to continue existing. Through demonstration of Federation principles, they secure their release and establish initial diplomatic relations with the Ferengi.
